Files and Description :
1. part1_assignment4.asm : Showing the converted digital voltage on device and rotate the stepper motor according to the analog voltage provided.
2. part2_assignment4.asm : Showing the calibrated paper dial across the
shaft of the stepper motor such that it denotes the analog voltage provided to the ADC.

part1_assignment4:
	->Connect the ADC in J2 port and stepper motor driver in J1. 
	->Showing the channel number on address field of display.
	->Showing the converted voltage equivalent on data field of display.
	->Change the input analog voltage and observe the changing voltage on data line of device 	and changing speed of motor.
	->Maximum input voltage is 4.75V


part2_assignment4:
	->Connect the ADC in J2 and Stepper motor driver in J1.
	->Point the pointer of the shaft initially to zero on calibrated paper dial.
	->Now change the input voltage and observe the change.
	->You can observe that amount of change can be measured by seeing the shaft pointer  	position on calibrated paper dial and the current voltage is shownw on the paper dial.
	->Maximum input voltage is 4V.
